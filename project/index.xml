      <description>According to the United Nations, Four billion people are ‘invisible’ due to lack of an address. Recent initiatives tend to name unknown areas by geocoding, which uses latitude and longitude information. Nevertheless settlements abut roads and such addressing schemes are not coherent with the road topology. Instead, our algorithm starts with extracting roads and junctions from satellite imagery utilizing deep learning. Then, it uniquely labels the regions, roads, and houses using some graph- and proximity-based algorithms.</description>

      <description>Disocclusions are one of the major problems in virtual views when rendered from DIBR. Disocclusion are holes occur at depth discontinuities near the object borders. Disocclusions needs to be handled using background data since they are part of it. However, distinguishing foreground-background requires the knowledge of depth. Thus we adopt inapinting methods and incorporated depth and developed methods to handle disocclusion in a plausible manner.

      <description>Three Dimensional Television (3DTV) and Free Viewpoint Television (FTV) are popular technologies for living room environments by providing immersive experience and look around facilities. These technologies required number of view points of data to provide such experience. However, capture and transmission of the required number of views is not a feasible solution. Thus Rendering and Inpainting solutions are provided to generate multiple view.

      <description>Depth-Image-Based Rendering (DIBR) of virtual views is a fundamental method in three dimensional 3-D video applications to produce different perspectives from texture and depth information. All DIBR methods suffer from artifacts in the resulting images, which are corrected by different post-processing. The proposed method is based on fundamental principles of3D-warping. The novelty lies in how the virtual view sample values are obtained from one-dimensional interpolation, where edges are preserved by introducing specific edge-pixels with information about both foreground and background data.</description>

      <description>Active noise control methods reduce unwanted noise. Moreover, active methods show superiority over passive control methods mainly for low frequency noise reduction. This project aims at investigating the use of an active noise control (ANC) system in ventilation system especially on a radial fan. A variety of methods were introduced to reduce unwanted noise based on the setup of the ventilation ducts. Mainly feed forward and feed back active noise control methods.</description>
