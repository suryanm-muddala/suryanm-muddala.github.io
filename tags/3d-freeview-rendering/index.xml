      <description>Three Dimensional Television (3DTV) and Free Viewpoint Television (FTV) are popular technologies for living room environments by providing immersive experience and look around facilities. These technologies required number of view points of data to provide such experience. However, capture and transmission of the required number of views is not a feasible solution. Thus Rendering and Inpainting solutions are provided to generate multiple view.

      <description>Depth-Image-Based Rendering (DIBR) of virtual views is a fundamental method in three dimensional 3-D video applications to produce different perspectives from texture and depth information. All DIBR methods suffer from artifacts in the resulting images, which are corrected by different post-processing. The proposed method is based on fundamental principles of3D-warping. The novelty lies in how the virtual view sample values are obtained from one-dimensional interpolation, where edges are preserved by introducing specific edge-pixels with information about both foreground and background data.</description>
