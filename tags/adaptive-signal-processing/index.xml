      <description>Active noise control methods reduce unwanted noise. Moreover, active methods show superiority over passive control methods mainly for low frequency noise reduction. This project aims at investigating the use of an active noise control (ANC) system in ventilation system especially on a radial fan. A variety of methods were introduced to reduce unwanted noise based on the setup of the ventilation ducts. Mainly feed forward and feed back active noise control methods.</description>
